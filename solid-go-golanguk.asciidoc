= SOLID Go design

== Welcome

Good morning and thank you for coming to my talk, I've come a long way and I'm honored to be the opening keynote speaker for today.

Before I begin, I want to give a nod to Damian's talk from last year and ask this question:

_How many Go programmers are there in the world?_

Does anyone want to have a guess?

_wait for responses_

OK, those are some good guesses, keep those in mind, we'll come back to this question at the end of the talk.

== Code review

_Who here does code review as part of their job?_

// slide: code review vs pair programming https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/730194450371117056

_Why do you do code review?_

If code review is there to catch bad code, how do you know if the code you're reviewing is good, or bad?

Now it's fine to say, "wow that source code is beautiful". Just like you might say, "this painting is beautiful", or "this room is beautiful" but these are subjective terms, and we're looking for objective ways to talk about the properties of code.

== Bad code

What are the properties of bad code that you might pick up on in code review.

=== Rigidity.
Is the code rigid, does it have such a straight jacket of overbearing types and parameters, that making modification difficult.

=== Fragility.
Is the code fragile, such that the slightest change ripples through the code base causing untold havoc?

=== Immobility.
Is the code hard to refactor, is it one keystroke away from an import loop?

=== Complexity.
Is there code for the sake of having code, are things over-engineered?

=== Verbosity.
Is it just exhausting to use the code?
When you look at it, can you even tell what this code is trying to do?

Are these positive sounding words?
Would you be pleased to see these words used in a review of your code?

Probably not.

== Good design

ok, so that's great, now we can say things like "i don't like this because it's too had to modify", or, "i don't like this because i cannot tell what the code is trying to do", but what about leading with the positive?

Wouldn't it be great if there were some ways to describe good design, not just bad design.
Wouldn't that make things easier, if we all spoke the same language of design.
Just as we all speak the same language of source code?

Wouldn't that be neat?

== Design principles

So back in 2003 Robert Martin published this book.
In it he described five principles of reusable software design, which he called the SOLID principles, after the first letters in their names.

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open / Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

This book is a little dated, the languages that it talks about are the ones in use a decade or more ago.
But, perhaps there are some aspects of the SOLID principles that may give us a clue about how to talk about a well designed Go programs.

So this is what I want to spend some time discussing with you this morning.

== Single responsibility principle

The first principle of SOLID, the S, is the single responsibility principle:

[quote, Robert C. Martin]
____
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
____

Now Go obviously doesn't have classes, instead we have the far more powerful notion of composition.
but if you can look past the archaic use of the word class, I think there is some value here.

Why is it important that a piece of code should have only one reason for change?
Because code that has a single responsibilty has the fewest reasons to change.

As distressing as the idea that your own code may change, it is far more distressing that code your code depends on is changing under your feet.
When your code does have to change, it should do so in response to a direct stimuli, it shouldn't be a victim of collateral damage.

=== The Go package model

Two words that describe how easy or difficult it is to change a piece of software are coupling and cohesion.

Coupling is simply a word that describes two things changing together--a movement in one induces a movement in another.

A related notion is the idea of cohesion, a force of mutual attraction. 
In the context of software, cohesion is the property of describing pieces of code are naturally attracted to one another.

To describe the units of coupling and cohesion in a Go program, we might talk about functions and methods, as is very common when discussing SRP but really I believe it starts with Go's package model.

=== Package names

In Go, all code lives inside a package, and a well designed package starts with its name.
A pacakge's name is both a description of its purpose, and a name space prefix.
Some examples of good packages from the Go standard library might be:

- net/http, which provides http clients and servers.
- os/exec, which runs external commands.
- encoding/json, which implements encoding and decoding of JSON documents.

When you use another package's symbols inside your own this is accomplished by the `import` declaration, which establishes a source level coupling between two packages.
They now know about each other.

=== Bad package names

This focus on names is not just pedantry.
A poorly named package misses the opportunity to enumerate its purpose, if indeed it had one.

    package server

What does the server package provide … well a server, hopefully, but which protocol ?

    package private

what does the private package provide? Things that I should not see? Should it have any public symbols ?

    package common

And package common, just like it's partner in crime, package utils, is often found close by these other offenders.

Because if you've gone down the path of this level of granularity, you’ll have a server package, you’ll need a client package, and a common package for things that fit in neither.

Catch all packages become a dumping ground for miscellany, Jack's of all trades.
And because they have many responsibilties they change frequently and without cause.

=== Go's UNIX philosophy

No discussion of Go, or decoupled design in general, would be complete without mentioning Doug McIlroy, who in 1964 described the power of pipes for composing programs.

McIlroy’s observations became the foundation of the UNIX philosophy; small, sharp tools which combine to solve larger tasks which oftentimes were not envisioned by the original authors.

I think that Go packages embody the spirit of the UNIX philosophy.
In effect each Go package is itself a small Go program, with a single responsibility.

== Open / Closed principle

The second principle, the O, is the open closed principle by Betrand Meyer

[quote, Bertrand Meyer, Object-Oriented Software Construction]
____
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
____
So, how does this advice apply to a language written 21 years later?
----
type A struct {
        year int
}

func (a A) Greet() { fmt.Println("Hello GolangUK", a.year) }

type B struct {
        A
}

func (b B) Greet() { fmt.Println("Welcome to GolangUK", b.year) }

func main() {
        var a A
        a.year = 2016
        var b B
        b.year = 2016
        a.Greet() // Hello GolangUK 2016
        b.Greet() // Welcome to GolangUK 2016
}
----
We have a type `A`, with a field `year`, which has a method `Greet`.
We have a second type `B` which _embeds_ an `A`.

A caller will see `B`'s methods overlaid on `A`'s because `A` is embedded, as a field, within `B`, and `B` can provide its own `Greet` method, obscuring `A`'s.

But embedding isn't just for methods, it also provides access to an embedded type's fields.
As you see, because both `A` and `B` are defined in the same package, `B` can access `A`'s private `year` field as if it were defined in `B`.

So embedding is a powerful tool which allows Go's types to be open for extension.
----
type Cat struct {
        Name string
}

func (c Cat) Legs() int { return 4 }

func (c Cat) PrintLegs() {
        fmt.Printf("I have %d legs\n", c.Legs())
}

type OctoCat struct {
        Cat
}

func (o OctoCat) Legs() int { return 5 }

func main() {
        var octo OctoCat
        fmt.Println(octo.Legs()) // 5
        octo.PrintLegs()         // I have 4 legs
}
----
In this example we have a `Cat` type, which can count its number of legs with the `Legs` method.
We embed this `Cat` type into a new type, an `OctoCat`, and declare that octocats have eight legs.

Though `OctoCat` defines it's own `Legs` method which returns 5, when the `PrintLegs` method is invoked, it returns 4.

This is because `PrintLegs` is defined on the `Cat` type, it takes a Cat as its receiver, and so it dispatches to `Cat`'s `Legs` method.

`Cat` has no knowledge of the type it has been embedded inside of, so its method set cannot be altered by embedding it.

Thus, we can say that Go's types are closed for modification.

In truth, methods in Go are little more than syntactic sugar around a function with a predeclared formal parameter, the receiver.
----
func (c Cat) PrintLegs() {
        fmt.Printf("I have %d legs\n", c.Legs())
}
----
The receiver is exactly what you pass into it, the first parameter of the function. 
----
func PrintLegs(c Cat) {
        fmt.Printf("I have %d legs\n", c.Legs())
}
----
And because Go does not support function overloading, `OctoCat`'s are not substitutable for regular `Cat`'s.
And this brings us to the next principle.

== Liskov substitution principle

Coined by Barbara Liskov, the Liskov substitution principle states, roughly, that two types are substitutable if they exhibit behaviour such that the caller is unable to tell the difference.

In a class based language, Liskov's substitution principle is commonly interpreted as a specification for an abstract base class with various concrete subtypes.

But Go does not have classes, or inheritance, so substitution cannot be implemented in terms of an abstract class hierarchy.

=== Interfaces

Instead, substitution is the purview of Go’s interfaces.

In Go, types are not required to nominate that they implement a particular interface, instead any type can implement an interface provided it has methods whose signature matches the interface declaration.

We say that in Go, interfaces are satisfied implicitly, rather than explicitly, and this has a profound impact on how they are used within the language.

=== Small interfaces

Well designed interfaces are more likely to be small interfaces; the prevailing idiom is an interface contains only a single method.

It follows logically that small interfaces lead to simple implementations, because it is hard to do otherwise.

Which leads to packages comprised of simple implementations connected by common _behaviour_.

So that brings me to `io.Reader`, one of the most popular interfaces in Go, and my favorite.

----
type Reader interface {
        // Read reads up to len(buf) bytes into buf.
        Read(buf []byte) (n int, err error)
}
----

The io.Reader interface is very simple;
`Read` reads data into the supplied buffer, and returns to the caller the number of bytes that were read, and possibly an error encountered during read.

Seems simple but it's very powerful.

Because Reader's deal with anything that can be expressed as a stream of bytes, we can construct readers to read just about anything; a constant string, a byte array, standard in, a network stream, a gzip'd tar file, the standard out of a command being executed remotely via ssh.
And all of these implementations are subtituable for one another because they fullfil the same simple contract.

=== Design by contract

So the Liskov substitution principle could be summarized in Go by this lovely aphorism from Jim Weirich.

[quote, Jim Weirich]
Require no more, promise no less

And this is a great segue into the next SOLID principle.

== Interface segregation principle

The fourth principle is the interface segregation principle.

[quote, Robert C. Martin]
____
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
____

In Go, the application of the interface segregation principle can refer to a process of isolating the behaviour required for a function to do its job.
As a concrete example, say I've been given a task to write a function that persists a Document structure to disk.
----
// Save writes the contents of doc to the file f.
func Save(f *os.File, doc *Document) error
----
I could specify this function, Save, which takes an `*os.File` as the destination to write the `Document`.
But this has a few problems

The signature of `Save` precludes the option to write the data to a network location.
Assuming that network storage is likely to become requirement later, the signature of this function would have to change, impacting all its callers.

`Save` is also unpleasant to test. 
Because this function works directly with files on disk, to verify its operation, the test would have to read the contents of the file after being written.

And I would have to ensure that `f` was written to a temporary location and always removed afterwards.

`*os.File` also defines a lot of methods which are not relevant to `Save`, like reading directories and checking to see if a path is a symlink.
It would be useful if the signature of the `Save` function could describe only the parts of `*os.File` that were relevant.

The `io` package provides an interface composed of the three basic io operations called `io.ReadWriteCloser`.
Using `io.ReadWriteCloser` we can apply the interface segregation principle to redefine `Save` to take an interface that describes more general stream shaped things.
----
// Save writes the contents of doc to the supplied Writer.r
func Save(rwc io.ReadWriteCloser, doc *Document) error
----
With this change, any type that implements the `io.ReadWriteCloser` interface can be substituted for the previous `*os.File`.

This makes `Save` both broader in its operation, and clarifies to the caller of `Save` which methods of the `*os.File` type are relevant to its operation.
And as the author of `Save` I no longer have the option to call those unrelated methods on `*os.File` as it is hidden behind the `io.ReadWriteCloser` interface.

But we can take the interface segregation principle a bit further.

Firstly, it is unlikely that if `Save` follows the single responsibility principle, it will read the file it just wrote to verify its contents--that should be responsibility of another piece of code.

So we can narrow the specification for the interface we pass to Save to just writing and closing.
----
// Save writes the contents of doc to the supplied Writer.
func Save(rc io.WriteCloser, doc *Document) error
----
Secondly, by providing `Save` with a mechanism to close its stream, which we inherited in this desire to make it still look like a file, this raises the question of under what circumstances will `rc` be closed.

Possibly Save will call Close unconditionally, or perhaps Close will be called in the case of success.
This presents a problem for the caller of `Save` as it may want to write additional data to the stream after the document is written.
----
type NopCloser struct {
        io.Writer
}

func (c *NopCloser) Close() error { return nil }
----
A crude solution would be to define a new type which embeds an `io.Writer` and overrides the `Close` method, preventing `Save` from closing the underlying stream.

But this would probably be a violation of LSP, as `NopCloser` doesn’t actually close anything. It’s probably ok, because the contract for close is quite loose, but I think we can do better.
----
// Save writes the contents of doc to the supplied Writer.
func Save(rc io.Writer, doc *Document) error
----
A better solution would be to redefine `Save` to take only an `io.Writer`, stripping it completely of the responsibility to do anything but write data to a stream.

By applying the interface segregation principle to our `Save` function, the results has simultaneously been a function which is the most specific in terms of its requirements--it only needs a thing that is writable--and the most general in its function, it can now use Save to save our data to anything which implements io.Writer.

[quote, Jack Lindamood]
____
A great rule of thumb for Go is **accept interfaces**, **return structs**.
____

And stepping back a few paces, this quote is an interesting meme that has percolated over the last year.
This tweet sized version lacks nuance, but I think it represents one of the first piece of defensible Go design lore.

== Dependency inversion principle

The final SOLID principle is the dependency inversion principle.

Which states:

[quote, Robert C. Martin]
____
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
____

What does dependency inversion mean in practice for Go programmers?

If you've applied all the principles we’ve talked about up to this point then your code should already be factored into discrete packages, each with a single well defined responsibility or purpose.

Your code should describe its dependencies in terms of interfaces, and those interfaces should be factored to describe only the behaviour those functions require.

In other words, there shouldn't be much left to do at this point.

So what I think Martin is talking about here, certainly the context of Go, is the structure of your import graph.
In Go, your import graph must be acyclic.
A failure to respect this acyclic requirement is grounds for a compilation failure, but more gravely represents a serious error in design.

All things being equal the the import graph of a well design Go program should be a wide, and relatively flat, rather than tall and narrow.

If you have a package whose functions cannot operate without enlisting the aid of another package, that is perhaps a sign that code is not well factored along package boundaries.

The dependency inversion principle encourages you to push the responsibility for the specifics, as high as possible up the import graph, leaving the lower level code to deal with abstractions -- the interfaces.

== A theme

Each of the SOLID principles are powerful statements about design, but taken together they have a central theme.

- SRP encourages you to structure the functions, types, and methods into packages that exhibit natural cohesion; the types belong together, the functions serve a singular purpose.
- OCP encourages you to compose simple types into more complex ones with embedding.
- LSP encourages you to express the dependencies between your packages in terms of interfaces, not concrete types. By defining small interfaces, we can be more confident that implementations will faithfully satisfy their contract.
- ISP takes that idea further and encourages you to define functions and methods that depend only on the behaviour that they need. If your function only requires a parameter with a single interface method, then it is more likely that this function has only one responsibility.
- DIP encourages you move the knowledge of the things your package depends on from compile time--in Go we see this with a reduction in the number of `import` statements used by a particular package--to run time.

The theme of all five of the SOLID principles is the management of dependencies between software units.
If you were to summarise this talk it would probably be; interfaces let you apply the SOLID principles to Go programs.
Because interfaces let Go programmers describe what their package provides--not how it does it.

This is all just another way of saying "decoupling", which is indeed the goal, because software that is loosely coupled is software that is easier to change.

[quote,Sandi Metz]
____
Design is the art of arranging code that needs to work _today_, and to be easy to change _forever_.
____

Because if Go is going to be a language that companies invest in for the long term, the maintenance of Go programs, the ease of change, will be a key factor in their decision.

== Coda

In closing, let's return to the question I opened this talk with.

_How many go developers are there?_

Here's my guess:

[quote, me]
____
By 2020, there will be 500k Go developers.
____

So what will half a million Go programmers do with their time?
Well, obviously, they’ll write a lot of Go code and, if we're being honest, not all of it will be good, and some will be quite bad.

Please understand that I do not say this to be cruel, but, every one of you in this room with experience with development in other languages--the languages you can from, to go--knows from your own experience that there is an element of truth to this prediction.

[quote, Bjarne Stroustrup, The Design and Evolution of C++. pp. 207.]
____
Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.
____
The opportunity for all Go programmers to make our langauge a success hinges directly on our collective ability to not make such a mess of things that people start to talk about Go the way that they joke about C++ today.

The narrative that derides other languages for being bloated, verbose, overcomplicated, and in need of replacement, could very well be turned upon Go at some point.
And I don't want to see this happen, so I have a request.

Go programmers need to start talking less about frameworks, and start talking more about design.
We need to stop focusing on performance at all cost, and focus instead on reuse at all cost. 

- What I want to see is people talking about how to use the language we have today, whatever its choices and limitations, to design solutions and to solve problems. 
- What I want to hear is people talking about how to design Go progams in a way that is well engineered, decoupled, reusable, and above all responsive to changing requirements.

Now, it's great that so many of you are here today to hear from the great lineup of speakers, but no matter how large GolangUK would ever grow, compared to the number of people who will use Go during its lifetime, we're just a tiny fraction.

So we need to tell the rest of the world how good software should be witten.
Good software, composable software, software that is ameable to change, and show them how to do it, in Go.
And this starts with you.

I want you to start talking about design, maybe use some of the ideas I presented here, maybe do your own research, then apply those ideas to your projects. Then I want you to:

- Blog about it, and if you can, open source your code.
- Teach a workshop about it
- Write a book about it,
- Come back to this conference next year and give a talk about it.

Because by doing these things we can promulgate a culture of Go developers who care about the design of programs that are built to last.

Thank you.
