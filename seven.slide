* Welcome

Hello!



* What's all this then?

Seven different ways to profile the same program.

Not all of them are available on every platform.

* What program ?

Let's not be coy, 

    go tool compile

* /usr/bin/time

* /usr/bin/time

Show time, show time -v, show /usr/bin/time and /usr/bin/time -v

Show how to use -toolexec and time -f â€¦ to profile a build

* Go debug / gctrace

Show godebug, gctrace, schedtrace

* Pprof / pkg/profile

Talk about taking whole program profiles,

* /debug/pprof

Show debug pprof, talk about the memstats interface 

Talk about the differences between full and timed mode

Show graphical view

* Perf

Show perf(1), show -g, 

* Flame graph

Show pprof -> flame graph using go-uber

* Trace

Show trace support, best til last.

* Why 

Different tools give you a different perspective on the performance of your application.

Maybe you don't need to know always use every one of these tools, but a working knowledge of most will serve you well.
